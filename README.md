# Appliances-Electricity-Consumption-Analysis
 A comparative machine learning model analyzing electricity consumption patterns across 20 cities in India, identifying key factors influencing usage and suggesting energy-saving measures that could reduce bills by up to 15

With the increasing demand for electricity, efficient energy consumption has become a critical challenge. A significant portion of household energy is consumed by appliances such as heaters, air conditioners, and refrigerators, leading to high power usage and frequent outages. This study aims to develop a machine learning-based energy prediction model that will help in understanding and forecasting appliance energy consumption. The dataset to be used is expected to contain various environmental and appliance-related factors such as temperature, humidity, light intensity, and time of usage. Several regression models, including Linear Regression, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, XGBoost, and MLP Regression, will be applied and compared based on their accuracy in predicting energy consumption. We expect ensemble models like XGBoost and Random Forest to perform better due to their ability to handle complex relationships in the data. The study also aims to identify key factors affecting energy usage, which can help in making better energy management decisions. Future work will focus on real-time monitoring and optimization techniques to reduce household energy consumption.
